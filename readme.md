**Fantasy football** is a game in which the participants serve as the general managers of virtual professional football teams. This repository contains code of RESTful (REST - Representational State Transfer) web service. It consists of 5 projects:
* Database - it contains definition of database objects that correspond to tables,
* Logic - it defines business rules,
* Migrations - it is console application that is used to run database migrations,
* Tests - it tests if business rules are followed,
* WebApplication - it is Web API application.

I created this this code to learn about .NET Core and [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper) - a simple object mapper for .Net.
